I've intensively debuged and tested this software,
though there's no warranty about using this software.
Also I have no responsibility about disadvantage you may suffer
by using this software.

== LICENSE ==
GPL

== ABOUT DIRECTORY ==
/-.
 /conf		: configuration files.
 /dal_mod	: Third party numerical calculus library.
 /man		: manual.
 /misc		: If you run files located this directory, it's easy to understand main program.
 /myest.m	: main program.
 /mylib		: library to run 'myest.m'.
 /outdir	: output directory where data is saved.
 /tools		: some nifty tools to analyze output data.

== HOW TO RUN ==
*RUN
1.  Just change your working directory to where 'myest.m' is.
2.  'clear all' variables and, if you want, set INIT PARAMETERS.
3.  Just run 'myest.m'.
3.1 You are supposed to be asked a file describing neuronal connections.
    Enter its name with the relative/absolute UNIX PATH format.


*OUTPUT
Data generated are to be saved in 'outdir'.

**variables
envSummary:   Artificially generated data.
env:    environment to generate variable 'envSummary'.
status: Describe how 'myest.m' has proceeded.

== ABOUT PARAMETERS ==
*DEFAULT PARAMETERS
You can freely edit files describing parameters in directorhy 'conf'.

**more professional configuration
If you want to toggle process like 'Ture neuronal connection', directory
a toggle flag in source code. 

*INIT PARAMETERS
If envirinmental struct variable 'env' for myest.m is exist, the value is used.
If some of field of it don't exist, you would be asked the value to fill in.
If you don't want to be annoyed about what you have to set, just do like the following.
'clear all; global env; env = struct(); myest.m'


== FAQ ==
*Q1: What's "Warning#1". 
The numver after message 'Warning' is error code.
Plese consult the section "WARNING CODE".

*Q2: I cannot rmdirectory from MATLAB terminal after running 'myest.m'
Do the follwing at MATLAB terminal
>> diary off;rmdir(status.savedirname,'s'); 

== WARNING CODE ==
*#1
If you want to generate artificial time seriese of firing, 
set 'status.GEN = 1' otherwise set 'status.GEN = 0'.

*#2
Warning: Number of basis used to estimate, and number of frames applied to
penalty function may be relatively too large for generated frames. 

*#3
